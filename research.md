I am an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science department at [VU Amsterdam](https://vu.nl/en/about-vu/faculties/faculty-of-science/departments/computer-science), where I am a member of the [Computer Systems](https://www.vucompsys.net/) group in the [At Large](https://atlarge-research.com/) team. I am also a part-time Assistant Professor at [TU Eindhoven](https://www.tue.nl/), where I am affiliated with the [Database](https://www.tue.nl/en/research/research-groups/data-science/data-and-artificial-intelligence/database-group/) systems group.

Before joining the VU, I was a Principal Researcher at the Virtual Machine Research Group at [Oracle labs](http://labs.oracle.com), and a member of the [GraalVM](https://github.com/graalvm) team.

Broadly speaking, I work on Programming Languages and Systems. I am especially intererested in all interactions between language VMs and Cloud runtimes (e.g., [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)), or Data processing systems (e.g., [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/)). I am interested in all aspects of such interactions, from programming models design to runtime optimization and performance engineering.

<!-- Broadly speaking, I work on language runtime systems and their interaction with other systems such as event-based server-side runtimes (like [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)), data analytics framweworks (like [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/)), and other emerging cloud and data analytics platforms.

<p>I am an active contributor to the <a href="https://github.com/oracle/graaljs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Graal.js</a> engine, and I often collaborate with other teams at Oracle, including the <a href="https://labs.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=labs:49:::::P49_PROJECT_ID:15" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MLE</a> group and the <a href="https://labs.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=labs:49:::::P49_PROJECT_ID:143" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dynamic Analysis</a> group. I also hold a part-time position at the <a href="https://www.tue.nl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eindhoven University of Technology</a>.</p>

I hold a Ph.D. from [USI Lugano](http://www.inf.usi.ch). I did research internships at [Mozilla Research](https://research.mozilla.org) and Oracle Labs, and was a guest of the [SSW institute](http://ssw.jku.at) of JKU Linz. Before that, I earned a M.Sc. at the [University of Pisa](http://calvados.di.unipi.it/paragroup/people/) working on high-performance parallel computing.
