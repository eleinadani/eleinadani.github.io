I am an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science department at [VU Amsterdam](https://vu.nl/en/about-vu/faculties/faculty-of-science/departments/computer-science), where I am a member of the [Computer Systems](https://www.vucompsys.net/) group in the [At Large](https://atlarge-research.com/) team. I am also a part-time Assistant Professor at [TU Eindhoven](https://www.tue.nl/), where I am affiliated with the [Database](https://www.tue.nl/en/research/research-groups/data-science/data-and-artificial-intelligence/database-group/) systems group.

Before joining the VU, I was a Principal Researcher at the Virtual Machine Research Group at [Oracle labs](http://labs.oracle.com), and a member of the [GraalVM](https://github.com/graalvm) team. While at Oracle, I was a [delegate](https://github.com/tc39/notes/pull/77/files) member of ECMA [TC39](https://tc39.es/).

Broadly speaking, I work on Programming Languages and Systems. I am especially intererested in all interactions between programming languages and data. I am interested in all aspects of such interactions, from programming models design to runtime optimization and performance engineering. My interests includes VM internals, JIT compilation, query processing, data serialization, memory formats and layouts, GPU acceleration, and performance optimization in general.

<!-- Broadly speaking, I work on language runtime systems and their interaction with other systems such as event-based server-side runtimes (like [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)), data analytics framweworks (like [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/)), and other emerging cloud and data analytics platforms. I am interested in all aspects of such interactions, from programming models design to runtime optimization and performance engineering.

<p>I am an active contributor to the <a href="https://github.com/oracle/graaljs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Graal.js</a> engine, and I often collaborate with other teams at Oracle, including the <a href="https://labs.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=labs:49:::::P49_PROJECT_ID:15" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MLE</a> group and the <a href="https://labs.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=labs:49:::::P49_PROJECT_ID:143" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dynamic Analysis</a> group. I also hold a part-time position at the <a href="https://www.tue.nl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eindhoven University of Technology</a>.</p>

I hold a Ph.D. from [USI Lugano](http://www.inf.usi.ch). I did research internships at [Mozilla Research](https://research.mozilla.org) and Oracle Labs, and was a guest of the [SSW institute](http://ssw.jku.at) of JKU Linz. Before that, I earned a M.Sc. at the [University of Pisa](http://calvados.di.unipi.it/paragroup/people/) working on high-performance parallel computing.

An updated list of my publications can be found on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AR2pK8QAAAAJ).

### Perspective students

We are always looking for excellent Ph.D students to join us. If you are interested in joining our group send me an email with your CV, research interests, and why you think there is a good match with our ongoing research.

If you are a VU or TU/e undergrad interested in doing research in our group just send an email to arrange an appointment to chat about current research opportunities and have a look at our [open projects](projects).

In _exceptional_ cases where there is a very good fit in terms of research interests, we can offer internship positions to students outside of the VU. If you think there is a good fit, send me an email with your CV, research interests, and research plans.
