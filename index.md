I am an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science department at [VU Amsterdam](https://vu.nl/en/about-vu/faculties/faculty-of-science/departments/computer-science). Previously, I was a Principal Researcher in the Virtual Machine  Research Group at [Oracle Labs](http://labs.oracle.com), and a member of the [GraalVM](https://github.com/graalvm) team.


My research lies at the intersection of Programming Languages and Systems. I study managed language runtimes (language VMs) and how they interact with modern software systems, with data management and data analytics as primary application domains. My goal is to improve performance and efficiency, and I am interested in all aspects of system design and implementation, from high-level programming models to runtime/compiler internals and hardware-aware optimization. My expertise includes VM internals, JIT compilation, query processing, data serialization, memory formats and layouts, GPU acceleration, and performance optimization in general.
