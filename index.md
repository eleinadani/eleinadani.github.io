I am an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science department at [VU Amsterdam](https://vu.nl/en/about-vu/faculties/faculty-of-science/departments/computer-science). Previously, I was a Principal Researcher in the Virtual Machine  Research Group at [Oracle Labs](http://labs.oracle.com), and a member of the [GraalVM](https://github.com/graalvm) team.


My research focuses on the intersection of Programming Languages and Systems. I am particularly fascinated by the various ways in which language runtimes can interact with large-scale software systems in areas such as Cloud computing or Data Analytics.
